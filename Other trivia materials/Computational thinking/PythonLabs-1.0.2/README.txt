PythonLabs is a collection of modules used for lab exercises in the textbook
*Explorations in Computing: An Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming*
by John S. Conery.

**IterationLab**: Simple iterative algorithms for searching and sorting, including animations for linear search and insertion sort.

**SpamLab**: An introduction to file processing and dictionaries, along with a project using a Bayesian spam filter.

**SieveLab**: A project on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm for generating lists of prime numbers.

**RecursionLab**: More sophisticated algorithms, using a divide and conquer strategy.

**BitLab**: Projects with binary encodings, including methods for simple error correction with parity bits and text compression with Huffman codes.

**MARSLab**: Using the game of Core War to explore the von Neumann architecture.

**RandomLab**: Creating lists of random numbers with a pseudo-random number generator.

**ElizaLab**: An introduction to issues in natural language processing, using a version of ELIZA written in Python.

**SphereLab**: Introduction to modeling and simulation, culminating in an N-body simulation of the movement of planets in the Solar System.

**TSPLab**: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with a genetic algorithm.

There is also a module named Tools that has animation and other support used by lab modules.

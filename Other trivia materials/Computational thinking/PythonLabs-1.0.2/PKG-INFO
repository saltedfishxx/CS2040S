        PythonLabs is a collection of modules used for lab exercises in the textbook
        *Explorations in Computing: An Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming*
        by John S. Conery.
        
        **IterationLab**: Simple iterative algorithms for searching and sorting, including animations for linear search and insertion sort.
        
        **SpamLab**: An introduction to file processing and dictionaries, along with a project using a Bayesian spam filter.
        
        **SieveLab**: A project on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm for generating lists of prime numbers.
        
        **RecursionLab**: More sophisticated algorithms, using a divide and conquer strategy.
        
        **BitLab**: Projects with binary encodings, including methods for simple error correction with parity bits and text compression with Huffman codes.
        
        **MARSLab**: Using the game of Core War to explore the von Neumann architecture.
        
        **RandomLab**: Creating lists of random numbers with a pseudo-random number generator.
        
        **ElizaLab**: An introduction to issues in natural language processing, using a version of ELIZA written in Python.
        
        **SphereLab**: Introduction to modeling and simulation, culminating in an N-body simulation of the movement of planets in the Solar System.
        
        **TSPLab**: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with a genetic algorithm.
        
        There is also a module named Tools that has animation and other support used by lab modules.
